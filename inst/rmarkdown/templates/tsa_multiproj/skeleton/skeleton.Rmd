/// introduction to this template \\\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This template can be used to produce a report from excel based HIS tools and DHIS2
data to produce time series analysis. 

- It is setup to run for one country at a time (knit_reports.R can be used to loop
over multiple countries)
- It is broken down by OPD (currently commented out) and IPD data. 
- It is organised in to a descriptive section to evaluate data quality, then a 
time series analysis section for projects with appropriate data. 
- Time series analysis is broken down by surveillance and impact
- Text within <! > will not show in your final document. These comments are used
to explain the template. You can delete them if you want.

/// setup \\\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Several packages are required for different aspects of  analysis with *R*. 
You will need to install these before starting. 

These packages can be quite large and may take a while to download in the
field. If you have access to a USB key with these packages, it makes sense to
copy and paste the packages into your computer's R package library 
(run the command .libPaths() to see the folder path). 

For help installing packages, please visit https://r4epis.netlify.com/welcome

This report is based on data management and data analysis scripts written by Alexander
Spina. If you have questions, please reach out to your epidemiology advisor. 
The report uses data available for projects (`r str_c(projects, collapse = ", ")`) 
in `r str_replace(z, "_", " ")` from old Excel based HIS tools as well as DHIS2 
databases as of `r format(Sys.Date(), format = "%d %B %Y")`.  
For a breakdown of the time period covered by different data sources see the 
appendix. 


## Objectives
- To monitor morbidity and mortality indicators of selected MSF OCA projects between
2014 and 2020
- To document any changes in these that might be attributed to the Covid-19 outbreak 
in 2020

For more details see the [concept note](https://tinyurl.com/yygxkhqw).


## Report structure
This report is structured by data from outpatient departments (OPD) and inpatient 
departments (IPD). [Note: OPD will be added in a later draft]

There are initial descriptive sections, for both OPD and IPD, to evaluate data
quality and availability. 

Then there is a section on time series analysis which uses only the most suitable
data available. There are two sections in time series analysis; one which is for 
surveillance (looking at excess in cases of diseases or death by week) and 
an impact section using segmented regression to look at whether COVID-19 had an 
effect on services utilisation. 

## Context 

The first case of confirmed Covid-19 in the country was in
`r filter(timelines, event == "Covid country") %>% summarise(min(calendar_week)) %>%  pull()`

<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/// covid_dates \\\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This chunk lists out relevant dates that covid arrived in the country, the region
and the project.

```{r covid_dates}

## use dataset of events by date
## save as object for later use
intervention_weeks <- timelines %>% 
  ## only keep the dates for covid cases
  filter(event %in% c("Covid suspect", "Covid confirmed", "Covid region")) %>% 
  ## only keep relevant columns 
  select(project, calendar_week, event) %>% 
  ## spread dataset in to wide format by project (event becomes columns)
  pivot_wider(id_cols = project, names_from = event, values_from = calendar_week)


## create table for output documents
## rename columns appropriately 
intervention_weeks %>% 
  select( Project = project, 
         "Suspected (MSF linelist)" = "Covid suspect", 
         "Confirmed (MSF linelist)" = "Covid confirmed", 
         "Confirmed (region)" = "Covid region") %>% 
  ## show as a formatted table in the output
  flextable() %>% 
  autofit() %>% 
  set_caption("Calendar week of Covid-19 case reports at MSF facilities and in the region, by project")

## only keep regional date for use in segmented regression 
intervention_weeks <- intervention_weeks %>% 
  select(project, 
         confirmed_region = "Covid region")

# Inpatient Departments (IPD) descriptive analysis

This section looks at availability and quality of data from inpatient departments
for each project.

/// counts_data_ipd \\\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This chunk is used to create eight tables - all done by week and project. 
(week is either admission or discharge week - depending what admissions_based
is set to). 
It creates patient counts (admissions or discharges), by age group and overall. 
Then disease case counts, by age group and overall. 
Then overall death counts, by age group and overall. 
Finally, disease specific death counts, by age group and overall. 

The reason to do big tables is that these can then be broken down later in the 
script, rather than continuously recreating the same base of counts to manipulate.

# Timeseries analysis 

This section uses the most appropriate data from project sites to look at 
trends over time. It is divided in to two sections. The first (surveillance) uses
regression forecasts to detect abnormal changes in LRTI and death rates over time. 
This analysis evaluates whether changes are either higher or lower compared to 
what would be expected based on historical trends.  
The second analysis (impact) uses segmented regression to assess whether there has been 
a change in patient presentations to the facility after COVID-19 introduction in 
the project location.  
Currently only data from IPD is considered, as these are more consistent 
in terms of sufficient case counts and reporting. 

## 1) Surveillance 

This analysis evaluates whether rates are either higher or lower 
compared to what would be expected based on historical trends. See technical 
details in the appendix for methods used.

### Interpretation 

Based on the data available from previous years, while taking in to account 
seasonality and trends, we would expect case (or death)
rates to be within the ranges (prediction intervals [PI]), 95% (or 99%) of the time. 

If observed case rates in the current year are above or below these ranges, it 
suggests there is a change in case rates compared to what we would expect. 

However, peaks above the range might not immediately suggest an unusual occurrence 
(like an outbreak). Observed peaks may be due to different causative 
organisms/strains for particular syndromes (e.g. in LRTI or diarrhoea) or changes
in reporting (e.g. shifting to DHIS2). 

The alert threshold is the level that suggests there has been a sustained change
in case rates (compared to baseline from previous years and considering previous 
weeks).

/// sincos_tsa \\\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This chunk fits a negative binomial regression to observed case data. 
The model includes the trend (linear change over time) as well as
two sine and cosine terms which account for seasonality. 
The most appropriate weeks for cosine are selected by fourier series. 
For details see: 
https://fable.tidyverts.org/reference/common_xregs.html
https://otexts.com/fpp3/useful-predictors.html
https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/timeseriesbook/frequency-and-time-scale-analysis.html

Prediction intervals are calculated manually for the fitted values of the model, 
based on quantiles of the binomial distribution. 
This means that at 95% alpha = 0.5 and at 99% alpha = 0.1.
This is based off work by Dirk Schumacher in the {trendbreaker} package:

/// forecast_tsa_validation \\\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This chunk is used to check how well the model is able to predict observed data. 
https://otexts.com/fpp3/evaluation.html

One method is to use training/testing datasets, i.e. fitting your model on data 
up to 2018, and then seeing how well this model predicts 2019 data. 
For details see: 
https://otexts.com/fpp3/accuracy.html

The second method (used here), is cross-validation. This consists of fitting your
model with all available data. Then rolling over all available data in windows 
and seeing how well it predicts one week ahead. 
For details see: 
https://otexts.com/fpp3/tscv.html

For an overview of measures used see regression metrics in {yardstick}
https://yardstick.tidymodels.org/reference/index.html

A good forecast has uncorrelated residuals (i.e. no more data could have been 
added to the model to improve fit) and the mean of residuals is zero (otherwise
there is a bias in the forecast - consider adding the mean to the forecast), 
residuals with constant variance and normally distributed residuals.

/// aberration_methods \\\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This chunk is used to create an alert threshold based on outbreak detection 
algorithms. 

The first option uses the improved Farington method. This fits a negative 
binomial glm (including trend) and down-weights past outbreaks (outliers) to 
create a threshold level. 

The second option use the glrnb method. This also fits a negative binomial glm 
but includes trend and fourier terms (so is favoured here). The regression is used
to calculate the "control mean" (~fitted values) - it then uses a computed 
generalized likelihood ratio statistic to assess if there is shift in the mean 
for each week. Note that the threshold for each week takes in to account previous
weeks so if there is a sustained shift an alarm will be triggered. 
(Also note that after each alarm the algorithm is reset)

/// sincos_tsa_deaths \\\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This chunk fits a negative binomial regression to observed case data. 
The model includes the trend (linear change over time) as well as
two sine and cosine terms which account for seasonality. 
The most appropriate weeks for cosine are selected by fourier series. 
For details see: 
https://fable.tidyverts.org/reference/common_xregs.html
https://otexts.com/fpp3/useful-predictors.html
https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/timeseriesbook/frequency-and-time-scale-analysis.html

Prediction intervals are calculated manually for the fitted values of the model, 
based on quantiles of the binomial distribution. 
This means that at 95% alpha = 0.5 and at 99% alpha = 0.1.
This is based off work by Dirk Schumacher in the {trendbreaker} package:

This is done by checking the residuals (or how far off the fitted values are

This chunk is used to check how well the model is able to predict observed data. 
https://otexts.com/fpp3/evaluation.html

One method is to use training/testing datasets, i.e. fitting your model on data 
up to 2018, and then seeing how well this model predicts 2019 data. 
For details see: 
https://otexts.com/fpp3/accuracy.html

The second method (used here), is cross-validation. This consists of fitting your
model with all available data. Then rolling over all available data in windows 
and seeing how well it predicts one week ahead. 
For details see: 
https://otexts.com/fpp3/tscv.html

For an overview of measures used see regression metrics in {yardstick}
https://yardstick.tidymodels.org/reference/index.html

A good forecast has uncorrelated residuals (i.e. no more data could have been 
added to the model to improve fit) and the mean of residuals is zero (otherwise
there is a bias in the forecast - consider adding the mean to the forecast), 
residuals with constant variance and normally distributed residuals.

/// aberration_methods_deaths \\\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This chunk is used to create an alert threshold based on outbreak detection 
algorithms. 

The first option uses the improved Farington method. This fits a negative 
binomial glm (including trend) and down-weights past outbreaks (outliers) to 
create a threshold level. 

The second option use the glrnb method. This also fits a negative binomial glm 
but includes trend and fourier terms (so is favoured here). The regression is used
to calculate the "control mean" (~fitted values) - it then uses a computed 
generalized likelihood ratio statistic to assess if there is shift in the mean 
for each week. Note that the threshold for each week takes in to account previous
weeks so if there is a sustained shift an alarm will be triggered. 
(Also note that after each alarm the algorithm is reset)

## 2) Impact 

This section evaluates the impact of Covid-19 on services by using
segmented regression for specific diseases of interest. 
It analyses if there have been changes in case numbers of other diseases 
(beyond LRTI) that could be related to the Covid-19 pandemic 
(e.g changes in health seeking behaviour or interruption/changes in service provision)   
It uses rates over time to see if these change after the date the 
first confirmed Covid-19 case was diagnosed in the project region (or the nearest
applicable region with reliable information). 

### Interpretation 

Similar to how we would interpret surveillance results above. 
Based on the data available from previous years (pre Covid-19 period), we 
calculate an expected rate for the post Covid-19 period, while taking the trend
(increase/decrease) over time and seasonal variation in to account. 
Then we calculate the percentage difference between the expected rate and the 
observed rate in the post Covid-19 period.  

A relevant change in rate would have both confidence intervals either above or 
below zero (i.e. increased or decreased) and a small p-value. *Nb.* small case numbers 
or noisy (inconsistent) data will produce unreliable results. Therefore a small 
p-value with a very wide confidence interval might not actually be relevant.

## In general, the negative binomial regression model can be written as follows.
# log(Y_t)= β_0 + β_1*t+ β_2*δ(t-t_0) + β_3*(t-t_0 )^+ + log(pop_t) + e_t
    # Y_t is the number of IPD cases observed in year t
    # pop_t is the population size in 100,000s in year t
    # t_0 is the last year (7th year) of the pre-period (including the transition time if there is any)
    # δ(x) is the indicator function (it is 0 if x≤0 and 1 if x>0) 
    # (x)^+ is the cut off operator (it is x if x>0 and 0 otherwise)
    # e_t denotes the residual
#  Therefore β_2*δ(t-t_0) + β_3*(t-t_0 )^+ is generalised linear part of post-period 
    #  which is zero in the pre-period.

## In general, the negative binomial regression model can be written as follows.
# log(Y_t)= β_0 + β_1*t+ β_2*δ(t-t_0) + β_3*(t-t_0 )^+ + log(pop_t) + e_t
    # Y_t is the number of IPD cases observed in year t
    # pop_t is the population size in 100,000s in year t
    # t_0 is the last year (7th year) of the pre-period (including the transition time if there is any)
    # δ(x) is the indicator function (it is 0 if x≤0 and 1 if x>0) 
    # (x)^+ is the cut off operator (it is x if x>0 and 0 otherwise)
    # e_t denotes the residual
#  Therefore β_2*δ(t-t_0) + β_3*(t-t_0 )^+ is generalised linear part of post-period 
    #  which is zero in the pre-period. 
#  The estimates of β_2 and β_3 will denote the effects of the intervention. 
#  More periods/terms can be added to control for seasonality and population

# Appendix 

## Technical details

The methods used here have been explained in detail elsewhere [@hyndmann_forecasting_2019; @salmon_monitoring_2016], 
the below is a brief summary of techniques. 

**Data sources** 
<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/// wards_included \\\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This chunk pulls together a sentence on whether maternal and ITFC wards were 
included in the analysis. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->

```{r wards_included}

wards_included <- if_else(medical_wards == "Medical", 
                          "This analysis only considered medical wards (not including maternal or inpatient therapeutic feeding centers)", 
                          "This analysis considered all medical wards (including maternal or inpatient therapeutic feeding centers)")

```

`r wards_included`. The various data sources used are listed below. 

<!-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/// data_source_dates \\\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This chunk lists out the data sources by project and which dates these 
sources were used between. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -->

```{r data_source_dates}

## using the cleaned IPD data
clean_data %>% 
  ## do by project and data source type
  group_by(project, source) %>% 
  ## get the beginning and end of each source reporting
  summarise(Start = min(calendar_week, na.rm = TRUE), 
            Stop  = max(calendar_week, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ## capitalise var names
  rename(Project = project, 
         Source = source) %>% 
  ## show as a formatted table in the output
  flextable() %>% 
  autofit() %>% 
  set_caption("Time periods which data sources were used by project")
```



**Data preparation**  

Given the variation in project activities over time, we present rates per 10,000
patient discharges rather than counts, as below: 

$rate_{cases} = \frac{n_{cases}}{ n_{discharge}} \times 10,000$

For weeks where the total number of patients was less than ten, counts were set 
to missing. 

Where weeks were missing counts, linear interpolation was used to fill these
gaps [@moritz_imputets_2017]. This involves fitting a line between the previous 
and the next available non-missing values, and then filling in the missing 
values based on that line.   

<!-- Note that the definition for chronic diseases between HIS tools and DHIS2 may be -->
<!-- inconsistent. In the old excel based HIS tools - chronic diseases reported together -->
<!-- with the following case definition:  -->
<!-- This does not include all chronic disease, only the following:    -->

<!--   - Diabetes Mellitus   -->
<!--   - Ischaemic heart disease   -->
<!--   - Hypertension   -->

**Descriptive**  

Classical decomposition was used [@hyndmann_forecasting_2019-1]. 
This involves breaking down the time series in to its component parts in order 
to understand whether there is a long-term upwards or downwards trend, whether 
there are differences by season and if there are longer term cycles beyond seasons.  

**Regression**  

A baseline of expected case rates was created by fitting a negative binomial regression
(generalised linear model) of case data between 2014 and 2019. 
This regression included a term for the trend as well as the two best fitting 
sine and cosine terms (using Fourier series) [@hyndmann_forecasting_2019-2]. 
Two Fourier terms were used as there are some arguments for irregular LRTI seasonality 
in warmer climates [@hirve_influenza_2016; @lam_nonannual_2018]. Where there is 
no strong second peak, the second term does not substantially shift the fitted regression. 
Fourier terms are calculated independently for each project and disease. 

This regression model is then used to predict what the case rate will be in each 
week of the following year. 
It was also used to calculate 95% and 99% prediction intervals [@hyndmann_forecasting_2019-3]. 
Prediction intervals were calculated based on quantiles of the binomial distribution
for each fitted value [@jombart_r_2020]. 
 
**Regression validation**  

To validate how well the model performed, two things were done. 
First, we looked at the differences between fitted values from the regression
and the observed values (residuals) [@hyndmann_forecasting_2019-4]. In a 
well-functioning model these residuals should be uncorrelated, of constant variance 
with a mean of zero and normally distributed. 
This just means that the fit should not be overly wrong at one particular time period 
over another. 
Second, we used time series cross validation [@hyndmann_forecasting_2019-5]. 
This involves creating multiple subsets of your data and seeing how well the 
model is able to predict four weeks ahead. 
From this you can get several measures which tells you how accurate the model is 
able to predict the observed values. 

<!-- **Aberration methods**   -->

<!-- We used the glrnb method for anomaly detection [@hohle_count_2008]. This was favoured -->
<!-- over the Farrington method as it allows for inclusion of seasonal terms.  -->
<!-- Similarly to the regression section, this also fits a negative binomial regression  -->
<!-- including trend and two Fourier terms on the baseline data. The regression is used -->
<!-- to calculate the "control mean" (~fitted values) - it then uses a computed  -->
<!-- generalized likelihood ratio statistic to assess if there is shift in the mean  -->
<!-- for each week.   -->
<!-- Note that the threshold for each week takes in to account previous -->
<!-- weeks; so if there is a sustained shift, the threshold for triggering an alarm is  -->
<!-- lowered. This is why you may see a drop in the threshold the week after a large  -->
<!-- peak.    -->
<!-- Also note that after each alarm the algorithm is reset. This is why the threshold -->
<!-- increases again after an alert is triggered.   -->
<!-- *N.b.* For deaths - the threshold was set to correspond to a 50% increase from  -->
<!-- the "control mean". [@wimmer_algoglrnb_nodate] -->

**Segmented regression**  

This uses negative binomial regression for interrupted time series analysis. 
This regression included a term for the trend as well as the two best fitting 
sine and cosine terms (using Fourier series) [@hyndmann_forecasting_2019-2]. On 
top of this it includes terms for being pre- or post- intervention  and number of days 
post-intervention.  
In this case the first week with a confirmed Covid-19 case in the region for each
project (or the nearest relevant region). 
Effectively this fits two regressions (one pre, one post), which enables the 
calculation of an incidence rate ratio (IRR). 
From the IRR and 95%CI it is possible to calculate percentage change with the 
formula below (where estimate is either IRR or CI). [@taljaard_use_2014]

$\%\Delta = 100 \times (estimate - 1)$
